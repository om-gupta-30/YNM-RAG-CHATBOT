GENERAL\n2.1 Purpose of Road Signs\nThe purpose of the road signs is to promote road safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of all types of road users moving on various categories of roads in both urban and non-urban areas. Road signs notify road users of regulations and provide warning as well as guidance needed for safe, uniform and efficient operation. g on various categories of roads in both urban and non-urban areas.",

It is important that these principles be given primary consideration in the selection and application of each road sign. 2 d sign. 2",

Design, placement, operation, maintenance, and uniformity are aspects that should be carefully considered in order to maximize the ability of a road sign to meet these five basic requirements. 2.3 Placement and Operation of Road Signs\nPlacement of road signs should be within road user's view. To aid in conveying proper meaning, road signs should be positioned with respect to the location or situation to which it applies.",

The fact that a sign is in good physical condition should not be a basis for deferring the removal or change, if it is so warranted. 2.4 Uniformity of Road Signs\nUniformity of signs simplifies the task of the road user because it helps in recognition and understanding, thereby reducing perceptionireaction time. Uniformity assists road users, traffic police and highway agencies by giving everyone the same interpretation message.",
