GENERAL\n2.1 Purpose of Road Signs\nThe purpose of the road signs is to promote road safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of all types of road users moving on various categories of roads in both urban and non-urban areas. Road signs notify road users of regulations and provide warning as well as guidance needed for safe, uniform and efficient operation.",

It is important that these principles be given primary consideration in the selection and application of each road sign.\n2",

Uniformity assists road users, traffic police and highway agencies by giving everyone the same interpretation message.
