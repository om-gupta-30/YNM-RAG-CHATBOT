  "131": "The image displays a page from a document, identified by \"IRC:67-2022\" and \"PLATE - V (Continued)\" at the top, and \"120\" at the bottom. It features six distinct road signs, each with a caption below it, and an additional diagram related to one of the signs.\n\nHere is a factual description of each visible sign, symbol, or diagram:\n\n1.  **Fig. 17.07 Hospital:**\n    *   A blue rectangular sign with rounded corners.\n    *   It contains a white square panel in the upper section.\n    *   Inside the white panel, there is a black outline of a hospital bed with a red capital \"H\" above its headboard.\n    *   Below the white panel, a white left-pointing arrow is depicted.\n    *   Beneath the arrow, the white text \"500m\" is present.\n\n2.  **Fig. 17.08 Emergency SOS Facility:**\n    *   A blue rectangular sign with rounded corners.\n    *   It contains a white square panel in the upper section.\n    *   Inside the white panel, a black symbol of a telephone handset is shown, with the receiver part curved towards the left.\n    *   Below the white panel, the white capital letters \"SOS\" are displayed.\n\n3.  **Fig. 17.09 U-Turn Ahead:**\n    *   A blue rectangular sign with rounded corners.\n    *   It features a large white U-shaped arrow pointing downwards. The top of the 'U' is wider, and the stem of the arrow is directed centrally downwards.\n    *   Below the arrow, the white capital text \"U-TURN\" is visible.\n\n4.  **Fig. 17.10 Pedestrian Subway:**\n    *   A blue rectangular sign with rounded corners.\n    *   It contains a white square panel.\n    *   Inside the white panel, a black silhouette of a person is shown descending a set of three stairs, facing right.\n\n5.  **Fig. 17.11 Foot Over Bridge:**\n    *   A blue rectangular sign with rounded corners.\n    *   It contains a white square panel.\n    *   Inside the white panel, a black silhouette of a person is shown ascending a set of three stairs, facing right.\n\n6.  **Fig. 17.12 Chair Lift:**\n    *   A blue rectangular sign with rounded corners.\n    *   It contains a white square panel.\n    *   Inside the white panel, a black silhouette of a person sitting in a chair lift is depicted, facing right and suspended from an overhead bar.\n\n7.  **Additional Diagram (next to Fig. 17.12 Chair Lift):**\n    *   This is a smaller, grid-like diagram.\n    *   It shows an identical black silhouette of a person sitting in a chair lift as seen in Fig. 17.12, but overlaid on a square grid pattern.\n    *   Arrows with the text \"-25-\" are visible at the top and right edges of the grid, indicating dimensional measurements.",
  "30": "Based on the provided image, which contains only text, there are no actual graphical road signs, symbols, or diagrams *visible* in the literal sense. However, the text *describes* various aspects of road signs, their components, and their mounting systems.\n\nHere is a factual description of the road signs, symbols, or diagrams *as described* in the text:\n\n1.  **Traffic Signs (General):**\n    *   Described as being mounted on support posts.\n    *   Their area determines the number of supports: up to 0.9 square meter signs use a single post; larger signs require two or more supports.\n    *   Foundations are concrete and designed for stability against wind loads and vandalism.\n\n2.  **Support Posts (for signs):**\n    *   **Materials:** Primarily Mild Steel (MS) or Galvanized Iron (GI) pipes.\n    *   **Shapes/Sections:** Circular Hollow Section (conforming to IS 1239), Rectangular Hollow Section (conforming to IS 1161, IS 3589), or Square Hollow Section (conforming to IS 4923).\n    *   **Bracing:** May be provided for additional support.\n    *   **Fixing:** Fixed to posts by welding (for steel posts) or by bolts and washers (for reinforced concrete or GI posts). Bolts are \"furred over\" with a hammer to prevent removal after tightening.\n    *   **Coatings (General):** All components (excluding the reflective portion of GI posts) are descaled, cleaned, primed, and painted with two coats of epoxy paint or powder coating.\n    *   **Coatings (Underground MS):** Any part of a mild steel post below ground is painted with three coats of redoxide paint.\n\n3.  **Railway Level Crossing Sign Posts (Specific Appearance):**\n    *   These sign posts have a distinct visual pattern: they are painted in 250 mm wide bands, which alternate between black and white.\n    *   The lowest band, adjacent to the ground, is black. (The specific color scheme for the *sign itself* is referenced elsewhere, in Section 15.71, but not detailed here).\n\n4.  **Overhead Signs (Structural Description):**\n    *   These signs require a robust support system designed to withstand specific loads.\n    *   **Load Considerations:** Must sustain dead load, live load, and wind load.\n    *   **Wind Load Specifications:** Designed to withstand a wind loading of 150 kg/m² normal to the sign face and 30 kg/m² transverse to the sign face.\n    *   **Walkway Load (if applicable):** If the overhead sign structure includes a walkway, a 250 kg concentrated live load must be considered in its design.\n\nIn summary, the text describes the structural and finishing specifications for various types of road sign support systems, including material, dimensions, installation methods, and coating requirements, with a specific visual detail for railway level crossing sign posts. No actual graphical representations are present.",
  "174": "The image displays a diagram representing a road intersection, specifically a minor side road joining a major road, with various road signs and markings.\n\nHere's a factual description of the visible road signs, symbols, and diagrams:\n\n1.  **\"STOP\" Signs (Octagonal):**\n    *   Two red octagonal signs with a white border and the word \"STOP\" in white capital letters are visible. One is positioned on the right side of the minor road approach, and the other on the left side, both preceding the junction with the major road.\n\n2.  **\"STOP\" Road Markings:**\n    *   Two rectangular white boxes containing the word \"STOP\" in black capital letters are painted across the lanes of the minor road, just before the solid white stop line at the junction.\n\n3.  **\"Give Way\" / \"Yield\" Signs (Inverted Triangle):**\n    *   Four white inverted triangular signs with a red border are present. Two are located on the major road, one on each side, preceding the junction from the bottom approach. Another two are on the major road, one on each side, preceding the junction from the top approach.\n\n4.  **T-Junction Warning Signs (Equilateral Triangle):**\n    *   Three white equilateral triangular signs with a red border are depicted, each containing a black symbol of a vertical line intersected by a horizontal line from the right, forming a 'T' shape.\n        *   One is on the major road, on the right side, for traffic approaching from the top.\n        *   One is on the major road, on the left side, for traffic approaching from the bottom.\n        *   One is on the minor road, on the right side, for traffic approaching the major road.\n\n5.  **Speed Breaker / Rumble Strip Markings:**\n    *   On the minor road, before the \"STOP\" line and markings, there are two sets of several parallel black triangular shapes (resembling a series of small '^' symbols) painted across each lane. These indicate speed breakers or rumble strips.\n\n6.  **Directional Arrows (Road Markings):**\n    *   White arrows are painted on the road surface to indicate traffic flow.\n        *   On the major road, there are upward-pointing arrows (for traffic moving up the diagram) and downward-pointing arrows (for traffic moving down the diagram) in each lane.\n        *   On the minor road, before the speed breakers, there are forward-pointing arrows in each lane indicating approach to the junction.\n\n7.  **Road Lines / Markings (General):**\n    *   **Solid Red Lines:** These denote the outer edges or kerbs of the road.\n    *   **Dashed White Lines:** These serve as lane dividers on both the major and minor roads.\n    *   **Solid White Line:** A thick solid white line is painted across the minor road, just after the \"STOP\" markings and before the junction, indicating a stop line.\n    *   **Solid Yellow Lines (Implied):** While not explicitly colored yellow, the diagram uses thick solid lines for the carriageway edges, which in some contexts could be solid white or yellow. The lane division is explicitly dashed white.\n\nThe overall diagram illustrates a controlled T-junction where the minor road is required to stop before joining the major road, with speed reduction measures (speed breakers) also present on the minor road approach.",
  "97": "The image displays a series of road signs and accompanying technical diagrams under the heading \"COMPULSORY CONTROL AND OTHER SIGNS\" from \"IRC:67-2022 PLATE - I (Continued)\".
